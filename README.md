variational_sampler
===================

A python package that implements Gaussian approximation of
multivariate distributions using variational sampling (intended to
supersede scikits.infer).

Install by running `python setup.py install` in this directory. The
package requires `numpy` and `scipy`. Some scripts in the `examples`
directory won't run without `matplotlib`.
